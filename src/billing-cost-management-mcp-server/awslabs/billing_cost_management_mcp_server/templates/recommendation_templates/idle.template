### Number formatting rules
- Format all currency values as "$X,XXX" with dollar sign and commas (e.g., "$4,000" not "4000 USD")

### TASK
Given one JSON recommendation from AWS Cost Optimization Hub
(optionally containing `computeOptimizerDetails`), generate an analysis with
**exactly four sections**:

1. **Summary – What happened?**
2. **Why – Key metrics & findings**
3. **How the summary was derived**
4. **Next steps**

### STATIC CONTEXT  (for LLM reasoning – do **not** echo verbatim)

IDLE CRITERIA (AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide)
• **EC2 instance** CPU < 5% AND network < 5 MB/day (14 d)
• **Auto Scaling Group** No member instance exceeds CPU 5% OR 5 MB/day network (14 d)
• **EBS volume** Idle = read + write < 1 IOPS/day (14 d) · Unattached = state available (32 d)
• **ECS service** CPU < 1% AND memory < 1% (14 d)
• **RDS instance** Zero DB connections AND low CPU AND low read/write IOPS (look-back)

METRIC CADENCE & DATAPOINTS
• ECS services 1-min samples → datapoints = 1,440 × days
• All other resources 5-min samples → datapoints = 288 × days

Performance-risk for idle findings is **VeryLow**.
Savings = 100% of on-demand cost once the resource is stopped or deleted.

### OUTPUT RULES
Return **four paragraphs** – Summary / How it is calculated / What happens / Next steps
Plain sentences only – **no tables, bullets, or adjectives**
Quote every numeric value exactly once.
No CLI walkthroughs, alternative scenarios, or RI / SP discussion.

### PARAGRAPH TEMPLATES
1  Summary – What happened
   "<ResourceType> <id> met idle criteria for <X> days and costs <currUSD>/month.
    Stopping or deleting it would save the full <currUSD>/month. Performance-risk VeryLow. [View in Compute Optimizer](link_url)."

2  How it is calculated
   "Idle criterion for <ResourceType>: <quote rule>. The recommendation engine analyzed <dpCount> datapoints (<cadence>) and saw peak CPU <cpu%>, network <netKB> KB/s, I/O <io if present>. All values are inside the idle threshold, so the resource is classified <Idle / Unattached>."

3  What happens if you act
   "Removing the resource eliminates <currUSD>/month—about <annualUSD> per year. No workload impact is expected."

4  Next steps
   "Create a backup or snapshot if needed, then stop or delete the resource. Monitor for unexpected demand; recreate or restart if required."

### EXAMPLE 1 – EC2 Instance Idle
Summary – What happened?
EC2 instance **i-0123abcd** met idle criteria for **14 days** and costs **$37.20/month**. Stopping it would save the full $37.20/month. Performance-risk VeryLow. [View in Compute Optimizer](link_url).

How it is calculated
Idle criterion for EC2 is that CPU is less than 5% and network is less than 5 MB/day over the 14 day lookback period. The recommendation engine analyzed **4,032 datapoints** (5-minute cadence) over 14 days and saw peak CPU **0.7%** and network **3 KB/s**. Both values meet the threshold, so the instance is classified Idle.

What happens if you act
Stopping saves $37.20/month—about **$446.00 per year**.

Next steps
Create an AMI if data is needed, then stop or terminate the instance. Restart later if activity resumes.

### EXAMPLE 2 – Auto Scaling Group Idle
Summary – What happened?
ASG **batch-jobs** met idle criteria for **14 days** and costs **$310.00/month**. Scaling desired/min/max to 0 would save the full $310.00/month. Performance-risk VeryLow. [View in Compute Optimizer](link_url).

How it is calculated
Idle criterion for ASG is that no member instance exceeds CPU 5% or 5 MB/day network over the 14 day lookback period. The recommendation engine analyzed **4,032 datapoints** (5-minute cadence) over 14 days and observed that the highest member CPU is **1.2%** and network is **2 KB/s**. Since the threshold is satisfied, the auto scaling group is classified Idle.

What happens if you act
Reducing capacity to 0 removes $310.00/month—about **$3,720.00 per year**.

Next steps
Set desired/min/max 0 or delete the ASG. Scale up again if workload returns.

### EXAMPLE 3 – EBS Volume Unattached
Summary – What happened?
EBS volume **vol-0fedcafe** is unattached for **32 days** and costs **$12.00/month**. Deleting it would save the full $12.00/month. Performance-risk VeryLow. [View in Compute Optimizer](link_url).

How it is calculated
EBS volume that is not attached to any EC2 Instance for 32 day lookback period is marked Unattached. The recommendation engine processed **9,216 datapoints** (5-minute cadence) in last 32 days and observed that the volume is Unattached.

What happens if you act
Deleting saves $12.00/month—about **$144.00 per year**.

Next steps
Snapshot if data is needed, then delete the volume. Restore later from the snapshot if required.

### EXAMPLE 4 – EBS Volume Idle (attached but inactive)
Summary – What happened?
EBS volume **vol-0abcidle** is attached but idle for **14 days** and costs **$8.00/month**. Deleting it after snapshotting would save the full $8.00/month. Performance-risk VeryLow. [View in Compute Optimizer](link_url).

How it is calculated
Idle criterion for EBS volume is that read + write is less than 1 IOPS/day over 14 day lookback period. The engine analyzed **4,032 datapoints** (5-minute cadence) over 14 days and observed peak read IOPS **0.3**, write IOPS **0.4**. Both below 1 IOPS/day, so the volume is classified Idle.

What happens if you act
Deleting saves $8.00/month—about **$96.00 per year**.

Next steps
Create a snapshot, then delete the volume. Restore later if the data is needed.

### EXAMPLE 5 – ECS Service Idle
Summary – What happened?
ECS service **orders-prod** met idle criteria for **14 days** and costs **$22.00/month**. Deleting it would save the full $22.00/month. Performance-risk VeryLow. [View in Compute Optimizer](link_url).

How it is calculated
Idle criterion for ECS is that CPU is less than 1% and memory is less than 1% over 14 day lookback period. The recommendation engine examined **20,160 datapoints** (1-minute cadence) over 14 days and saw peak CPU **0.3%** and memory **0.4%**. Both satisfy the threshold, so the service is classified Idle.

What happens if you act
Removing the service saves $22.00/month—about **$264.00 per year**.

Next steps
Verify the application is no longer required, then delete the service. Recreate if demand returns.

### EXAMPLE 6 – RDS Instance Idle
Summary – What happened?
RDS instance **db-reports** met idle criteria for **14 days** and costs **$160.00/month**. Stopping it would save the full $160.00/month. Performance-risk VeryLow. [View in Compute Optimizer](link_url).

How it is calculated
Idle criterion for RDS is zero DB connections and low CPU/I/O. The engine analyzed **4,032 datapoints** (5-minute cadence) and saw connections **0**, CPU **1.1%**, read/write ≤ 5 IOPS. All meet the threshold, so the instance is classified Idle.

What happens if you act
Stopping removes $160.00/month—about **$1,920.00 per year**. Storage charges continue until snapshots are deleted.

Next steps
Create a final snapshot, stop or delete the DB, and monitor for unexpected connections. Restore or start if required.
