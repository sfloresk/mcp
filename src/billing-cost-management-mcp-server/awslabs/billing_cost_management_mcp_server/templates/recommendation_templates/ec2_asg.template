### STATIC CONTEXT (for your reasoning - DO NOT echo this in output)

#### EC2 Auto Scaling Group Metrics Analysis
Compute Optimizer analyzes these primary metrics across all instances in the group:

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Cpu (CPUUtilization)**: Percentage of allocated EC2 compute units used across instances
- **Memory (MemoryUtilization)**: Percentage of memory used (requires CloudWatch agent)
- **GPU_PERCENTAGE (GPUUtilization)**: Percentage of allocated GPUs used (requires CloudWatch agent with NVIDIA GPU)
- **GPU_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE (GPUMemoryUtilization)**: Percentage of GPU memory used (requires CloudWatch agent with NVIDIA GPU)

**Network Metrics:**
- **NETWORK_IN_BYTES_PER_SECOND (NetworkIn)**: Bytes received by instances on all network interfaces
- **NETWORK_OUT_BYTES_PER_SECOND (NetworkOut)**: Bytes sent by instances on all network interfaces
- **NETWORK_PACKETS_IN_PER_SECOND**: Number of packets received by instances
- **NETWORK_PACKETS_OUT_PER_SECOND**: Number of packets sent by instances

**Scaling Metrics:**
- **DesiredCapacity**: The desired number of instances in the group
- **MinSize**: The minimum number of instances in the group
- **MaxSize**: The maximum number of instances in the group
- **Instance count over time**: Scaling patterns and instance lifecycle events
- **Scaling activity frequency**: How often scaling occurs and why

Memory metrics are vital:
- Without memory data, instances with low memory usage may appear optimized
- Memory metrics can identify up to 4x more savings opportunities
- Memory often drives instance sizing requirements
- CloudWatch agent installation required for memory metrics

#### Supported and Unsupported ASG Types
**Supported ASGs:**
- Single EC2 instance types
- Mixed EC2 instance types
- Various scaling policy types (target tracking, predictive, simple, step, scheduled)

**Unsupported ASGs:**
- Spot Instances (for rightsizing, but idle recommendations are supported)
- G and P instance families
- ECS or EKS workloads
- Mixed AMD and Intel instances
- Mixed instances using instance weights
- Mixed x86 and Graviton instances
- Mixed platforms (Windows, SQL Server, Linux)

#### Finding Classifications
- **Not Optimized**: Instance types or group configuration can be improved
- **Optimized**: Instance types and configuration meet workload requirements efficiently
- **Idle**: Instances have minimal utilization across all metrics
- **Unavailable**: Insufficient data for recommendation

#### Finding Reason Codes
- **CPUOverprovisioned**: Low CPU utilization indicates excess compute capacity
- **CPUUnderprovisioned**: High CPU utilization risks performance issues
- **MemoryOverprovisioned**: Low memory utilization indicates excess memory
- **MemoryUnderprovisioned**: High memory utilization risks performance issues
- **NetworkBandwidthOverprovisioned**: Low network I/O indicates excess bandwidth
- **NetworkBandwidthUnderprovisioned**: High network I/O may indicate bandwidth constraints
- **NetworkPPSOverprovisioned**: Low network PPS indicates excess capacity
- **NetworkPPSUnderprovisioned**: High network PPS indicates potential bottlenecks
- **EBSThroughputOverprovisioned**: Low EBS throughput indicates excess capacity
- **EBSThroughputUnderprovisioned**: High EBS throughput indicates potential bottlenecks
- **EBSIOPSOverprovisioned**: Low EBS IOPS indicates excess capacity
- **EBSIOPSUnderprovisioned**: High EBS IOPS indicates potential I/O bottlenecks

#### Lookback Period and Analysis Method
- **Default 14-day**: Standard analysis with basic metrics
- **32-day (DAYS_32)**: Free enhanced period for more reliable recommendations
- **93-day (DAYS_93)**: Paid enhanced infrastructure metrics for comprehensive analysis
- **Statistical approach**: Uses 99.5 percentile (P99.5) to exclude outliers
- **Headroom**: Default 20% CPU and memory capacity buffer

#### Threshold and Headroom Settings
**CPU Utilization Threshold:**
- P99.5 (default): Excludes top 0.5% of utilization points
- P95: Excludes top 5% of utilization points
- P90: Excludes top 10% of utilization points

**CPU/Memory Headroom:**
- Default 20% (PERCENT_20): Recommends instances with utilization below 80%
- PERCENT_30: Recommends instances with utilization below 70%
- PERCENT_10: Recommends instances with utilization below 90% (memory only)
- PERCENT_0: Recommends instances with utilization up to 100% (CPU only)

**Preset Profiles:**
- Max Savings: CPU threshold P90, CPU headroom 0%, memory headroom 10%
- Balanced: CPU threshold P95, CPU headroom 30%, memory headroom 30%
- Default: CPU threshold P99.5, CPU headroom 20%, memory headroom 20%
- Max Performance: CPU threshold P99.5, CPU headroom 30%, memory headroom 30%

#### Migration Effort and Platform Considerations
**Migration Effort:**
- **Very Low**: Same family size change or minor launch template update
- **Low**: Generation change (m5.xlarge → m6i.xlarge)
- **Medium**: Family change (c5.xlarge → m5.xlarge)
- **High**: Architecture change (x86 → Arm/Graviton)

**Platform Differences:**
- **Hypervisor**: Xen vs Nitro hypervisor
- **NetworkInterface**: Standard vs enhanced networking capabilities
- **StorageInterface**: Standard vs NVMe storage interface
- **InstanceStoreAvailability**: Presence of instance store volumes
- **VirtualizationType**: PV vs HVM virtualization
- **Architecture**: x86 vs Arm/Graviton CPU architecture

**Performance Risk:**
- 0-1: Very Low risk
- >1-2: Low risk
- >2-3: Medium risk
- >3-4: High risk

#### ASG Configuration Components
- **Type**: SingleInstanceType or MixedInstanceTypes
- **Allocation Strategy**: Prioritized or LowestPrice (for mixed instances)
- **Scaling Policies**: Target tracking, step scaling, simple scaling, predictive scaling
- **Desired/Min/Max**: Current capacity settings
- **Launch Template/Configuration**: Instance type and configuration details

#### Savings Calculation
- By default uses On-Demand pricing (savingsEstimationMode: PublicPricing)
- Can incorporate Savings Plans and Reserved Instances (savingsEstimationMode: CostExplorerRightsizing)
- Can incorporate custom pricing discounts (savingsEstimationMode: CostOptimizationHub)

#### Idle Auto Scaling Group Criteria
- CPU utilization < 5% across all instances in the group
- Network I/O < 5MB/day across all instances in the group
- Consistent pattern over the lookback period (14+ days)

#### Inferred Workload Types
Compute Optimizer might identify specific workload types running in the ASG:
- AmazonEmr
- ApacheCassandra
- ApacheHadoop
- Memcached
- Nginx
- PostgreSql
- Redis
- Kafka
- SQLServer

## Example Output

Summary
Auto Scaling group "web-servers" (arn:aws:autoscaling:us-west-2:123456789012:autoScalingGroup:abc-123) is not optimized with finding reason codes CPUOverprovisioned and MemoryOverprovisioned. The current m5.xlarge instances can be replaced with t3.medium instances, reducing monthly cost from $604.80 to $174.72, saving $430.08 (71%) with low performance risk. The group's capacity settings (min: 2, max: 10, desired: 4) remain unchanged. View in console: [link].

Why – The analysis behind this recommendation
This Auto Scaling group uses m5.xlarge instances (4 vCPUs, 16GB memory) with min/max/desired capacity of 2/10/4 instances. Analysis shows the following metrics triggered the finding reason codes: CPUOverprovisioned (CPU Max: 12.5%, meaning only 0.5 vCPUs used of 4 available) and MemoryOverprovisioned (Memory Max: 18.3%, using only 2.9GB of 16GB available). Other metrics show similarly low utilization: Network In: 2.5 MB/s, Network Out: 3.1 MB/s. The group scales up rarely (3 times in 93 days) and never uses more than 6 instances. This data comes from 26,784 five-minute samples over 93 days, using the P99.5 threshold that excludes only the highest 0.5% of utilization spikes. The model applies a 20% CPU and memory headroom buffer to ensure the recommended instances can handle normal workload variability.

What happens if you implement this recommendation
Switching to t3.medium instances (2 vCPUs, 4GB memory) would reduce monthly cost from $604.80 (4 x m5.xlarge at $151.20 each) to $174.72 (4 x t3.medium at $43.68 each), saving $430.08 (71%) or approximately $5,160 annually. These savings are calculated using On-Demand pricing and don't account for any Savings Plans or Reserved Instance discounts you may have. The performance risk is low (1.2) because even at peak utilization, the recommended instances would run at approximately 25% CPU and 73% memory utilization, leaving sufficient headroom for unexpected demand spikes. Migration effort is Low as this requires only updating the launch template with the new instance type and performing an instance refresh.

Next Steps
* Install the CloudWatch agent on your instances to collect memory metrics if you haven't already done so. This ensures the most accurate recommendations based on both CPU and memory usage.
* Enable enhanced infrastructure metrics (32-day free or 93-day paid) as you're currently using the standard 14-day lookback period, to capture more utilization data and identify any weekly or monthly patterns.
