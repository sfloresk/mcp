    """Tool for deleting imported models from Amazon Bedrock.

    This class implements the delete_imported_model tool which allows users to
    permanently remove custom models that were previously imported into Amazon Bedrock.
    It handles the deletion process by accepting either a model ID or ARN.

    The tool performs validation of the model identifier and ensures proper cleanup
    of the model resources. This operation is irreversible and should be used with
    caution as it permanently removes the model from Bedrock.

        This tool permanently deletes a custom model that was previously imported into Amazon Bedrock.
        This operation cannot be undone and will permanently remove the model from your AWS account.

        ## Usage Instructions
        1. Provide either the model name or ARN as the model_identifier parameter
        2. You can get a list of available models using the list_imported_models tool
        3. Verify you're deleting the correct model before proceeding

        ## Important Considerations
        - This operation is IRREVERSIBLE - the model will be permanently deleted
        - Any applications using this model will fail after deletion
        - Consider backing up important model data before deletion
        - Deletion may take some time to complete for large models

        ## When to Use
        - When you no longer need a specific model
        - To manage costs by removing unused models
