# Amazon Data Processing MCP Server

The AWS DataProcessing MCP server provides AI code assistants with comprehensive data processing tools and real-time pipeline visibility across AWS Glue and Amazon EMR-EC2. This integration equips large language models (LLMs) with essential data engineering capabilities and contextual awareness, enabling AI code assistants to streamline data processing workflows through intelligent guidance — from initial data discovery and cataloging through complex ETL pipeline orchestration and big data analytics optimization.

Integrating the DataProcessing MCP server into AI code assistants transforms data engineering workflows across all phases, from simplifying data catalog management with automated schema discovery and data quality validation. Additionally, it streamlines ETL job creation with intelligent code generation and best practice recommendations. It accelerates big data processing through automated EMR cluster provisioning and workload optimization. Finally, it enhances troubleshooting through intelligent debugging tools and operational insights. All of this simplifies complex data operations through natural language interactions in AI code assistants.


## Key features

## Setup

Add these IAM policies to the IAM role or user that you use to manage your Glue, EMR-EC2 or Athena resources.

### Read-Only Operations Policy

For read operations, the following permissions are required:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "glue:GetDatabase*",
        "glue:GetTable*",
        "glue:GetPartition*",
        "glue:GetConnection*",

        "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Write Operations Policy

For write operations, we recommend the following IAM policies:

* AWSGlueServiceRole: Enables Glue service operations including job execution, crawler runs, and data catalog modifications

**Important Security Note**: Users should exercise caution when --allow-write and --allow-sensitive-data-access modes are enabled with these broad permissions, as this combination grants significant privileges to the MCP server. Only enable these flags when necessary and in trusted environments.

**Resource Management Limitation**: The DataProcessing MCP Server can only update or delete resources that were originally created through it. Resources created by other means cannot be modified or deleted using the DataProcessing MCP Server.


## Quickstart

This quickstart guide walks you through the steps to configure the Amazon Data Processing MCP Server for use with both the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en/downloads) IDE and the [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli). By following these steps, you'll setup your development environment to leverage the Data Processing MCP Server's tools for managing your Glue, EMR and Athena resources.

**Set up Cursor**

1. Open Cursor.
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top right to open the settings panel, click **MCP**, **Add new global MCP server**.
3. Paste your MCP server definition. For example, this example shows how to configure the Data Processing MCP Server, including enabling mutating actions by adding the `--allow-write` flag to the server arguments:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "aws.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest",
        "--allow-write"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      },
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```
After a few minutes, you should see a green indicator if your MCP server definition is valid.

4. Open a chat panel in Cursor (e.g., `Ctrl/⌘ + L`).  In your Cursor chat window, enter your prompt. For example, "Look at all the tables from my account federated across GDC"

**Set up the Amazon Q Developer CLI**

1. Install the [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-installing.html) .
2. The Q Developer CLI supports MCP servers for tools and prompts out-of-the-box. Edit your Q developer CLI's MCP configuration file named mcp.json following [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-mcp-configuration.html). For example:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["aws.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

3. Verify your setup by running the `/tools` command in the Q Developer CLI to see the available Data Processing MCP tools.

Note that this is a basic quickstart. You can enable additional capabilities, such as [running MCP servers in containers](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#running-mcp-servers-in-containers) or combining more MCP servers like the [AWS Documentation MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-documentation-mcp-server/) into a single MCP server definition. To view an example, see the [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-setup) guide in AWS MCP Servers on GitHub. To view a real-world implementation with application code in context with an MCP server, see the [Server Developer](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) guide in Anthropic documentation.
